<h1>Cayde 6 Lore...</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Cayde-6">Cayde-6</a> was an Exo Guardian and former Vanguard Leader for the Hunter class, His coveted weapon, <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Ace_of_Spades">The Ace of Spades</a> , pictured to the left, is the pinacle of his fighting abilities. He weilds his weapon to pursue the health and well being of both <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/The_Traveler">The Traveler</a> and also all the other planets in the solar sytem! Amongst many other things cayde has done for the Guardians, he also, payed the ultimate sacrafice and was killed in battle, or so we thought... But just like any other great, he wasn't actually gone, his ghost was killed though and with no <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Ghost">Ghost</a>, and only a Light-forged replica of the Ace of Spades, Cayde assisted The Guardian and his old Vanguard comrades in the final battle against <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/The_Witness">The Witness.</a>  </p>

            <h1>My Personal Cayde Opinion...</h1>
            <p>I personally love Cayde for many different reasons, my main reason is because of the way he acts. He is just such a goofy character who just loves to joke around even in the most serious of times. *Spoiler Alert* When Cayde dies in the game there is a pretty decently long scene and he still mamges to make a few whitty quips while actively dying. I aspire to be as geniunely joyful as the man Cayde-6</p>
